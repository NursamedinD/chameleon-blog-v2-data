      "content": "Perhaps the most notable trait of chameleons is there ability to change their color, how do they do this you ask? Their outer layer of their skin is see-through, under this layer lie special cells filled with pigment. To change to a new color, the brain sends a message to these cells to expand or contract. As this happens different pigments are released which mix together to create new skin tones. These colors can communicate moods, as well being used to attract mates and to either warm up or cool down.",

      "content": "Most animals comes with two eyes, this is true with chameleons, but what makes them unique is that they can move each their eye's individually. This essentially gives them a wide range of site, making it easy to detect danger or prey. Another key body part of chameleons is their tongue, capable of extending quite far, the tongue is said to be almost spring-loaded which lets the chameloen grab its prey before it can get an idea of what happened, the tip of the tongue is also somewhat adhesive which makes it easy to nab prey.",
